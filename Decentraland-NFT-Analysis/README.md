The data mining notebooks extract all the data, do some feature engineering, and save the final datasets as .csv. 

The data exploration notebooks look at simple plots, like histograms of the variables, and create some complex data visualizations.

The data models notebooks train the models, analyze the results, and create visualizations of the results.
